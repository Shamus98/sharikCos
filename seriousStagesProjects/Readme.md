Done: 

1)FramesDiff between currently and firstly(static background)

2) Gaussian blurs

3) Binaries

4) NMS

5) Add Bboxes

6) Take those frames which have bboxes and take bbox more const values

7) Don't take certain size area (high left area)

Problems:

1)Little bboxes don't define because condition(change condition)

2)If this method don't help then delete waste area and keep movebands and cases

3)Or we will use no big yolo or think about texture bands
